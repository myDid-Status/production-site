*Investigating* - We’re aware of users experiencing blackchain wallet synchronization problems. It seems to be due to an unavailable machine in our infrastructure. We’re currently investigating. {{< track "2024-07-27 10:26:00" >}}

*Increased monitoring* - The service is back online, it was a material issue. We are heavily monitoring the machine for few days to see if the problem is solved properly by the host. {{< track "2024-07-28 10:36:00" >}}
